Welcome to MAD's documentation!
===============================

This documentation gives a complete guide to install and use MAD, the Madeus Application Deployer. MAD is a PYTHON implementation of the `Madeus <https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01858150v1>`_ model. Its purpose is to offer a way to define a low-level deployment process and coordinate this deployment in an efficient and reliable manner. MAD is low-level but offers a highly generic deployment model.
